# ds4vita

**Download**: https://github.com/xerpi/ds4vita/releases

**Enable the plugin:**

1. Add ds4vita.skprx to taiHEN's config (ux0:/tai/config.txt):
	```
	*KERNEL
	ux0:tai/ds4vita.skprx
	```
2. You need to refresh the config.txt by rebooting or through VitaShell.

**Using it for the first time (pairing the controller):**

1. Go to Settings -> Devices -> Bluetooth Devices
2. Press SHARE+PS on the DS4 for about 3-4 seconds, until the lightbar blinks very quickly
3. The DS4 will then connect and be paired (don't press over it when it appears)

**Using it once paired (see above):**
1. Just press the PS button and it will connect to the Vita

**Note**: If you use Mai, don't put the plugin inside ux0:/plugins because Mai will load all stuff you put in there...
